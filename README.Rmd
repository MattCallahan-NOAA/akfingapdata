## akfingapdata

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This pacakge provides functions to download [gap_product](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/gap_products/) tables from the AKFIN database using web services. 

## Installation
``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("MattCallahan-NOAA/akfingapdata")
```

## Authentication

In order to use this package you must be authorized to view these data.
Please contact matt.callahan@noaa.gov for assistance setting up web service credentials.
Authorized users will be issued a secret text string in a .txt file, which is encrypted using the create_token() function.
This token is valid for about ten minutes. If it expires you will get the following error:

Error: lexical error: invalid char in json text.
                                       <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <style t
                     (right here) ------^
                     
This is a generic web service error, rerun create_token() to continue querying.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(akfingapdata)
library(tidyverse)

token<-create_token("Callahan_token.txt")

```

## Metadata
A good first step is to download the column descriptions for these data.
The authors of these tables mercifully named columns in such a way that no column has different definitions in different tables, so one metadata table will suffice for all tables. 

```{r message = FALSE}
metadata<-get_gap_metadata_column()

```

## Lookup tables

Some functions require survey_definition_id, species_code, area_id, start_year, and end_year as parameters.  
In order to correctly define these parameters, first download several lookup tables. 

```{r }
# download species_code
taxa<- get_gap_taxonomic_classification()

# find species codes for shortraker rockfish
 taxa %>% filter(grepl("shortraker", tolower(common_name)))
```

```{r}
# download survey, area, and stratum group tables
survey<-get_gap_survey_design()
area<-get_gap_area()
stratum<-get_gap_stratum_groups()

#combine spatial lookup tables
stratum<-stratum %>%
  left_join(survey %>%
              # remove year specific information from survey, we only need the region codes
              group_by(survey) %>%
              summarize(survey_definition_id=max(survey_definition_id)), 
            by="survey_definition_id") %>%
  left_join(area,  by=c("area_id"="area_id", "survey_definition_id"="survey_definition_id", "design_year"="design_year"))
              # I get a many to one here that gives me two extra rows

# look for the western Gulf
# 805
stratum %>%
  filter(survey=="GOA",
         area_type=="REGULATORY AREA",
         grepl("western", tolower(area_name))
         )
```

## Data tables
Each table has a separate function to pull data from it.
Agecomp, Biomass, Catch, CPUE, Length, Sizecomp, and Specimen tables have hundreds of thousands to over 100 million rows.
Parameters are built into the web services and functions to prevent enormous downloads.
Default parameters are as follows: survey_definition_id= 98 (Bering Sea), area_id = 1 (EBS Subarea 1), species_code=21740 (Pollock), start_year = 1990, and end_year = 3000 (will need to get updated in 976 years).
Agecomp, biomass, and sizecomp are calculated at the area_id level and survey_definition_id and area_id are built into those tables.

```{r}
# Get Western GOA shortraker, agecomp, biomass from 2010 onward

# No agecomp data for this area/species
goasr_ages<-get_gap_agecomp(survey_definition_id = 47,
                area_id = 805,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023)

goasr_biomass<-get_gap_biomass(survey_definition_id = 47,
                area_id = 805,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023)

goasr_sizecomp<-get_gap_sizecomp(survey_definition_id = 47,
                area_id = 805,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023)

head(goasr_sizecomp)

```

```{r}
# No agecomp for shortraker at that area, run gulfwide instead.
head(get_gap_agecomp(survey_definition_id = 47,
                area_id = 99903,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023))
```



Catch, CPUE, Length, and Specimen tables contain haul level data.
The web service joins the haul and cruises tables to allow querying by survey.

```{r}
# Get catch, cpue, length frequency, and specimens at a haul level for Western GOA shortraker

# The catch table only includes records where the species were caught
goasr_catch<-get_gap_catch(survey_definition_id = 47,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023)

# The CPUE table includes zeros and thus has many more records
goasr_cpue<-get_gap_cpue(survey_definition_id = 47,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023)

# The length table has ~150 million rows as of 2023. 
# Even with filters it may load a large amount of data
# For WGOA shortraker below it pulled 40367 records. 
# Add timing to track how long this takes

goasr_length<-get_gap_length(survey_definition_id = 47,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023)


# The specimen table contains length, sex, weight, and age data for individual fish.
goasr_specimen<-get_gap_specimen(survey_definition_id = 47,
                species_code = 30576,
                start_year=1990,
                end_year=2023)

head(goasr_specimen)
```

To query more than one species (or area) at a time use the lapply function or a for loop. 

```{r}
# Get rougheye and shortraker biomass for the WGOA
taxa %>% filter(grepl("rougheye", common_name))

myspecies <- c(30050, 30051)

goa_resr_biomass<-lapply(myspecies, FUN = function(x) get_gap_biomass(
  survey_definition_id = 47,
  area_id = 805,
  species_code = x,
  start_year=2007,
  end_year=2023)) %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  arrange(year)


head(goa_resr_biomass)

# trying the same thing with the other functions produces the same generic error as when the token is expired.

```

## Cruise and haul tables
Haul and cruise level details are available for download as well.
Download these tables in full and manipulate in R. 
```{r}
gap_haul<-get_gap_haul()

gap_cruise<-get_gap_cruise()

head(gap_haul)

```


## Split Fractions
This table shows what proportion of fish are in the eastern or western GOA. 
It is downloaded in its entirety.
```{r}
split_fractions<-get_gap_split_fractions()
```
